## Philosophy

We wanted to make a self-hosted version of tools like Intercom and Drift for companies that have privacy and security concerns about having customer data going to third party services. Weâ€™re starting with chat right now but we want to expand into all forms of customer communication like email campaigns and push notifications.

Stay tuned! We'll be posting a more detailed roadmap soon ðŸ¤“
